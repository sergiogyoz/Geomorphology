The article mentions that the erosion rates are more accurate in larger basins (page 136, second column, first paragraph), I assume because there are more 10Be data points. Does the same hold true for erosion rates derived from data collected at depth, or near the penetration depth?

From equation two, what does the "∝" symbol mean?

In figure 3, it seems that the catchment basin's average slope levels off at a certain point (about 35) while ksn continues to increase. Is this leveling off due to critical slope? Are ksn values impacted by critical slope values?

What exactly is a "hillslope gradient?" Is this just another term for slope?

In figure 6, similar to average slope, hillslope angle seems to reach a limit around 35°. Is this also related to critical slope? Or, could it be related to a "critical erosion rate" (a term I'm coining) of about 300 m/Ma?

Is soil more likely to have landslides than bedrock? Since these are different parameters, won't the erosion rate calculated be affected?

The study avoided using basins with major knickpoints. What effect do knickpoints have in skewing erosion rate that is different from landslides?
