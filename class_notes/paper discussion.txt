detrital means...?

linear models don't differ that much from non linear (when the stochasticity is taken into account on the linear model)

dearth?  dwarf?

on channels the difference in lithology contributes to the dispersion of the data (assumed)

What's the fire cycle?

the used Dams estimation using suspended sediment?

threshold landscapes?

"correcting for elevation and latitude on a pixel by pixel basis"?





Qs

- are there landslides on the moon?
- how we determined if a landscape is landslide dominated?
- why would you avoid a knickzone?
- what's the "angle" of a landscape? of a basin? what makes it a good representative angle?
