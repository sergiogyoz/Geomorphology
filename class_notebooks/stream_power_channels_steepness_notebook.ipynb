    "**What is this notebook?**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook illustrates the evolution of detachment-limited channels in an actively uplifting landscape. The landscape evolves according to the equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    " \\frac{d z}{d t} = -K_\\text{sp} A^{m_{sp}} S^{n_{sp}} + U\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "Here, $K_{sp}$ is the erodibility coefficient on fluvial incision, which is thought to be positively correlated with climate wetness, or storminess (this is hard to quantify) and to be negatively correlated with rock strength (again, rock strength is hard to quantify). $m_{sp}$ and $n_{sp}$ are positive exponents, usually thought to have a ratio, $m_{sp}/n_{sp} \\approx 0.5$. $A$ is drainage area and $S$ is the slope of steepest descent ($-\\frac{dz}{dx}$) where $x$ is horizontal distance (positive in the downslope direction) and $z$ is elevation. (If slope is negative there is no fluvial erosion.) $U$ is an externally-applied rock uplift rate field.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fluvial erosion term is also known as the stream power equation. Before using this notebook you should be familiar with this equation from class lectures and reading. \n",

    "\n",
    "In this exercise you will modify the code to get a better understanding of how rock uplift rates and patterns and the erodibility coefficient control fluvial channel form.\n",
    "\n",
    "Start at the top by reading each block of text and sequentially running each code block (shift - enter OR got to the _Run_ pulldown menu at the top and choose _Run Selected Cells_). \n",
    "\n",
    "If you just change one code block and rerun only that code block, only the parts of the code in that code block will be updated. (E.g. if you change parameters but don't reset the code blocks that initialize run time or topography, then the cahnged parameters will apply on the current topography.) \n",

All answers and supporting figures (produced using the code) should be embedded in a file (e.g. ppt, txt, link to a google doc, Jupyter Notebook, ...) that you hand in.

(Note that you can keep running the main evolution loop - Code Block 7 - and the different plotting blocks without running the code blocks above them. You may also want to change $tmax$ in Code Block 4.) How did you decide that the landscape reached steady state? [These landscapes may not reach a perfect steady state. Close is fine.] Include appropriate plots. \n",

Rerun the entire notebook, and continue to run the main evolution loop - Code Block 7 - until the landscape reaches steady state. Provide a plot that illustrates that the landscape is in steady state. What aspects of the landscape have changed in comparison with the base landscape from question 1?\n",

Rerun the entire notebook, and continue to run the main evolution loop - Code Block 7 - until the landscape reaches steady state. Compare this landscape with the one produced in the first question.
